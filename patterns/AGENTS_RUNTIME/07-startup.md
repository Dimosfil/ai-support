## Startup, Goal, And Restore

- Treat short greetings, thanks, acknowledgements, and status-neutral messages
  as no-ops unless they include an explicit task, path, command, error, or
  project question. Do not run startup restore or read project files for those
  messages; reply briefly and ask what the user wants to do next.
- On the first concrete task in a new chat/session, before task-specific
  startup restore, planning, implementation, or command execution, perform a
  quiet staged GI instruction update check. For a GI command, prefer the
  project-local `tools/get-gi-context.ps1`; otherwise use
  `tools/check-instruction-kit-updates.ps1` when present so file reads do not
  enter model context. Resolve the accepted shared-instruction source and
  first compare only the installed version in
  `tools/project-memory/instruction-kit.json` with accepted-source `VERSION.md`.
  If the versions are equal and there are no explicit skipped migrations,
  report `pending migrations: 0` and stop the update check without reading
  `CHANGELOG.md`, `INDEX.md`, migration directory entries, or migration bodies.
  Explicit skipped migrations remain pending even at equal versions. If the
  accepted version is newer, enumerate unapplied
  migration IDs, then read and apply only those pending migration files before
  task-specific work. `CHANGELOG.md` and `INDEX.md` are optional maintenance
  references, not normal startup inputs. In instruction-kit
  metadata, `update_check.enabled: true` authorizes both checking and applying;
  a missing `auto_apply_pending_migrations` field defaults to `true` for
  backward compatibility. Finding a newer version is not a completed startup
  check: do not merely report it or tell the user to run a later update command.
  Skip application only when metadata explicitly sets the update check or
  automatic application to `false`, or when a concrete source-access,
  filesystem, repository-scope, safety, or merge-conflict blocker exists.
  Name the blocker and continue with current local instructions unless the user
  explicitly requested `gi обновить`. Do not read `updates/`, old chat examples,
  broad project files, or unrelated source repositories for this startup check.
  Keep the user-facing output to one compact status line or include it in the
  first substantive reply. That compact status must explicitly include the
  pending migration count, including `0` when no migrations are pending.
- Treat the update checker as policy evidence and a handoff to agent execution,
  not as the migration executor. When enabled and pending, read the listed
  accepted migrations, apply and verify their file changes, then record metadata
  before task-specific work; require no extra command or confirmation. Recheck
  the installed version and pending count after recording. If a legacy startup
  helper only prints availability, run the checker or read metadata directly and
  continue this flow. A helper's unsupported `-Apply`, notice-only behavior, or
  absence of an executor does not disable automatic application.
- Claim that automatic application is disabled only when current metadata has
  JSON boolean `false` at `update_check.auto_apply_pending_migrations` or
  `update_check.enabled`; cite the exact file path, key, and value. Missing keys
  mean enabled. Invalid JSON or non-boolean values mean unverified policy and a
  concrete configuration blocker. Distinguish policy, execution, and blockers:
  say "updates not applied: <verified reason>" if execution did not complete;
  never invent a user opt-out or report an unchecked pending count as zero.
- Before implementation, derive the task goal and observable success criteria
  from the user's request and relevant project context. A clear bounded fix,
  review, or instruction edit is sufficient without a project-goal interview.
  - Do not require the user to confirm a restatement of an already clear goal.
  - Ask focused questions only when missing information materially changes the
    result or scope; continue independent authorized work while waiting.
  - For a genuinely undefined product, clarify the target user, expected outcome,
    and success criteria before dependent implementation decisions.
- Track the agreed goal during the thread.
  - Reference it in first planning reply and after major changes.
  - In final output, report completion status against each goal criterion and
    list any remaining gap as a clear blocker.
- For `gi start`, `gi restore`, and title-only first messages, restore only the
  minimum orientation needed for the next turn: local instructions, the latest
  handoff summary, and compact git state. The latest handoff summary is the
  primary continuation artifact for a new chat: read it enough to recover the
  current topic, key theses or decisions, blockers, and next useful direction.
  Do not treat seeing only its filename, timestamp, or metadata as successful
  restore. Keep the response compact and do not read unrelated full runbooks,
  memory notes, logs, diffs, or older summaries unless a concrete task needs
  them.
- Treat `gi start sprint`, `gi sprint start`, and equivalent active-sprint
  wording as more specific than plain `gi start`: route them through the
  configured task-manager workflow, not generic startup restore.
- Treat `gi local sprint`, `gi sprint local`, `gi локальный спринт`,
  `gi спринт локально`, and equivalent explicitly local sprint wording as a
  local execution workflow, not as a request to resolve or mutate task-manager
  state. Read the routed sprint/task-manager module before acting, then use
  only the supplied chat context or project-local checklist location documented
  by local instructions.
- Do not treat remembered plans, old refactoring phases, stale task notes, or
  local commits ahead of a remote as the next action during `gi start` or
  `gi restore`. Mention them only as compact context when relevant, then ask for
  the user's current task instead of offering to continue, run, push, or finish
  them.
- Treat `gi init <source>`, `init <source>`, `инит <source>`, and
  `инициализируй <source>` that point to the canonical shared-instruction Git
  repository `https://github.com/Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`, the
  shorter GitHub repo form `Dimosfil/general-instructions.git`, the current
  shared-instruction checkout/cache, `GENERAL_INSTRUCTIONS_HOME`, or another
  known shared-instruction source as a shared-instruction bootstrap/startup
  request, even when the user supplies the source as a Markdown link.
  Read the repository's local instructions and follow the documented `gi`
  bootstrap rules. Do not reinterpret that form as Git initialization, OpenCode
  setup, project creation, or skill creation unless the user explicitly names
  that action.
  Treat `инит правила <source>` the same way when `<source>` points to
  `general-instructions`. Examples such as
  `инит <path-to-general-instructions>` and
  `инит правила <path-to-general-instructions>` mean "load or initialize
  instruction rules from the existing shared-instruction source"; they never
  mean `git init`. Do not create folders, initialize `.git`, or suggest
  `npm init` / `python -m venv` for this form.
