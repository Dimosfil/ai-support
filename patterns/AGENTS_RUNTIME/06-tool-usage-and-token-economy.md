## Tool Usage And Token Economy

- Treat `cached input` as a symptom, not the main optimization target. Optimize
  for smaller total live context: current input plus cached context.
- Start a new session for unrelated new tasks when old context is no longer
  useful, and use compact handoff summaries instead of carrying long
  investigation history forward.
- Do not print full `git diff` output by default. Prefer `git diff --stat` and
  targeted queries for relevant files or patterns.
- For first-pass project study, read local instructions, README, manifests, and
  config entry points before building a file map. Use recursive scans only after
  a targeted search fails or the task clearly requires repository-wide
  inventory.
- When creating or running a test, smoke-check, or verification plan, verify
  exact commands, CLI flags, ports, routes, health endpoints, request payload
  fields, and environment variables from current project-local instructions,
  runbooks, manifests, config entry points, or source code. Treat handoff
  summaries, task notes, screenshots, and old chat examples as status evidence,
  not as authoritative command contracts; do not reuse stale ports, payloads, or
  flags without checking the current project.
- Treat `gi refactor`, `gi рефактор`, `ги рефактор`, and equivalent full-project
  refactor wording as requests to refactor the entire current project according
  to all applicable GI rules. This is a broad implementation command, not a
  request for a proposal only. First read project-local instructions, README,
  manifests, architecture/runbooks, project-memory specifications, connected
  project registers, and relevant tests or build contracts. Build a concise
  refactor plan that covers architecture boundaries, configuration boundaries,
  hard-coded deploy/user/runtime/model/product values, development-tool versus
  generated-product boundaries, SOLID/DRY/clean-code issues, duplicated
  business logic, oversized modules, dependency direction, typed or validated
  contracts, tests, and project-memory updates. Separate structural refactor
  work from development work such as new behavior, validation, observability,
  integrations, runtime flows, or new public contracts; also keep verification
  and service operations labeled as such. Execute in small verifiable batches,
  preserving user-visible behavior unless the user explicitly changes it. Ask
  before destructive operations, data migrations, public API or storage
  contract changes, dependency replacements, broad formatting-only churn, or
  touching private/external paths. After each meaningful batch, run documented
  checks for the affected area, update durable project-memory specs for
  behavior or architecture changes, keep generated/rebuildable artifacts out of
  commits unless project rules say otherwise, and report remaining risks or
  follow-up batches. If the project is too large to complete safely in one turn,
  complete the first coherent batch and leave an executable continuation plan.
- Treat `gi stack` and `ги стек` as requests to find or build the current
  project's technology stack inventory. First search project-local instructions,
  README, docs indexes, runbooks, and
  `tools/project-memory/specs/technology-stack.md` for a canonical stack link or
  inventory before scanning broadly. If a current inventory exists, verify key
  facts against manifests, lockfiles, config, run instructions, and source entry
  points, then report the stack and gaps. If no inventory exists, create or
  update the canonical stack inventory from current evidence and add a concise
  pointer near the beginning of the first relevant project doc when local rules
  allow documentation edits. Do not install dependencies, start services,
  rebuild indexes, call external APIs, read secrets, or inspect private paths
  outside the project root for this command unless the user explicitly approves
  that scope.
- Treat `gi info` and `ги инфо` as requests to find or build the current
  project's orientation inventory: purpose, target users or stakeholders,
  visible functionality, common workflows, technology stack, and documentation
  gaps. First read project-local instructions, README, docs indexes, runbooks,
  existing project-memory specs, and the canonical stack inventory before broad
  scans. Verify facts against current manifests, config, run instructions,
  source entry points, and tests. If the inventory is missing or stale, update
  durable project documentation and the canonical stack inventory as needed;
  keep implementation-driving contracts in project memory and link to them
  instead of duplicating them into the overview. If the verified facts already
  match the existing documentation and stack inventory, report that the project
  information is current and do not rewrite files. If only part of the inventory
  changed, update only the affected purpose, visible functionality, workflow,
  command, operation, troubleshooting, or stack sections; avoid unrelated
  reformatting, translation churn, and whole-file rewrites. Write new or updated
  project information in the configured project working-environment languages
  from `tools/project-memory/system-preferences.json`, preserving the selected
  order from `gi язык` / `gi language`: the first language is primary, and each
  additional configured language gets one clear translation. Do not install
  dependencies, start services, rebuild indexes, call external APIs, read
  secrets, or inspect private paths outside the project root for this command
  unless the user explicitly approves that scope.
- Treat `gi logic`, `ги логика`, and `gi logic <source> [focus]` as requests
  to recover, document, or adapt project logic through GI project memory. With
  no source, inspect the current project only and build or update the durable
  logic map: core domain modules, workflow contracts, invariants, data flows,
  integration boundaries, and verification evidence, preferably under
  `tools/project-memory/specs/`. With an explicit URL, repository, or local
  folder, first read the private-scope rules in
  `patterns/AGENTS_RUNTIME/10-private-scope-and-missing-context.md`, state the
  active project root and external source, then study only task-relevant
  instructions, README/docs, manifests, project-memory specs, entry points, and
  focused source modules. If the user supplies a focus term such as a component,
  role, client, bot, worker, API, or workflow name, search for that focus before
  broad scans. Extract portable behavior contracts and module responsibilities
  before editing code; do not blindly copy another project's source, secrets,
  generated artifacts, local config, or private data. If implementation is
  requested or clearly implied, adapt the relevant logic into the current
  project's architecture and configuration boundaries, update project memory
  with the source/evidence mapping, and run the smallest documented checks that
  cover the adopted behavior. If the requested source is a URL, prefer official
  repository/docs pages and avoid crawling unrelated pages or downloading large
  assets unless the user asks for that scope.
- Do not read large files in full by default, including large `index.html`,
  bundled JS/CSS, logs, lockfiles, generated files, and build artifacts. Prefer
  targeted searches, heads, tails, or small line ranges, such as
  `Get-Content -TotalCount`, `Get-Content -Tail`, and `Select-String`.
- Command examples use PowerShell on Windows. Use equivalent head, tail,
  line-range, and targeted-search commands on other shells.
- Preserve text encodings when editing files. On Windows, do not rewrite source
  files with PowerShell pipelines such as `Get-Content ... | Set-Content ...`
  unless both read and write encodings are explicit and known correct. Prefer
  `apply_patch`, editor-native saves, or language APIs that read and write the
  file with an explicit encoding such as UTF-8. If non-ASCII text appears as
  mojibake after a command, stop, restore the last clean file version, and
  reapply only the intended small patch.
- Search for specific symbols, paths, errors, or patterns before doing broad
  repository scans.
- Before meaningful implementation, bug fixes, or refactoring, trace the
  scenario and record a scoped source-backed mapping: scenario -> mechanism ->
  contract owner -> change location -> verification. Correct causes at their
  owner; use or extend existing mechanisms and justify bypasses. Follow the
  gate in `patterns/ARCHITECTURE_AND_CODE_QUALITY.md` without extra approval or
  broad audits.
- Before changing a feature with a recorded workflow contract, read the
  contract and preserve its user-visible sequence, branches, background work,
  loading/error states, and verification guarantees unless the user explicitly
  changes the agreement.
- When the user explicitly asks to work "by GI" or with equivalent strict
  wording, treat project-memory writeback and verification as completion gates,
  not optional cleanup. If meaningful behavior, workflow, data-model,
  integration, observability, or architecture changes occur, update the relevant
  durable project-memory specification in the same scoped batch before
  finishing unless the user explicitly defers that update.
- For non-trivial feature work, keep the feature idea, functional description,
  workflow contract, implementation plan, sprint breakdown, task breakdown,
  definitions of done, and verification linked together. Tasks do not replace
  the feature contract: tasks say what to change, while the contract says what
  behavior must remain true.
- After meaningful work on a feature, workflow, business rule, data model, or
  architecture, update the relevant project-memory specification in the same
  scoped change. A handoff summary does not replace durable project memory.
- After a meaningful code or configuration batch, verify source-of-truth
  consistency across backend, frontend, tests, docs, generated examples, build
  metadata, and project-memory specs that can carry the same default, policy,
  workflow, or contract. Do not finish with duplicate independent defaults or
  stale specs unless the remaining drift is recorded as an explicit follow-up.
- Do not print large logs. Prefer tails and targeted error searches.
- For verification, count or query HTML elements programmatically instead of
  printing the whole HTML document.
- Do not produce broad artifacts, such as zip archives, or run full check
  matrices unless the user explicitly asks for that scope.
- Split multi-step R&D into separate tasks when later steps do not need the
  full previous reasoning trace.
- Broader scans, longer logs, or larger check suites are acceptable for incident
  debugging, explicit user requests, release checks, or unclear failures after
  targeted searches.
- Final responses should summarize only the changes, checks, and current status;
  do not restate the full investigation context.
